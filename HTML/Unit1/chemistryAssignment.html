        Chemistry Assignment
    </h1>

    <p>
        Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition and behaviour of matter.
        It is a fascinating the field that explores the building blocks of universe.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Chemical Elements
    </h2>

    <p>
        The <strong style="background-color: yellow;">periodic table</strong> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements.
        Each elements is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen and O for oxygen.
        Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Chemical Equations
    </h3>

    <p>
        Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations.</i>
        Here's an example of a chemical reaction:
        <br>
        2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> <var> -> </var> 2H<sub>2</sub>O
        <br>
        This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) and Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) to form water (H<sub>2</sub>O).
    </p>

    <h4>
        Important Concepts
    </h4>

    <p>
        Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions.
        It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.
        <sub>Subscipts</sub> indicates the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup>
        represent charges or the number of atoms in an iron.
    </p>

    <h5>
        Conclusion
    </h5>

    <p>
        Chemistry plays a crusial role in understanding the world around us.
        From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies,
        Chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.
